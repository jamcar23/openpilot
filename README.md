# What is flexpilot?

Flexpilot is a fork of openpilot focused on flexibility, live tuning, and other experimental features.

# What is openpilot?

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of supported [car makes, models and model years](#supported-cars). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers.

# Installation
Easiest way is with this command:

`cd /data && rm -rf openpilot && git clone https://github.com/jamcar23/openpilot.git --branch r2++ --depth 1 && reboot`

Using the `r2++` branch is the easiest way to get the latest "release" features of this fork. Generally, all features are optional so there shouldn't be any harm in always running the latest features.

# Features
This serves as a general overview of notable changes made from other forks. Note: this fork is intended to be used by advanced users who know what they're doing. This fork is focused on experimentation and as such it will allow for things that are more unsafe then other forks.

## Live Tuning
Tuning is a huge feature in this fork, there are over 100 params in opParams, most of which are live. Please see [opParams](https://github.com/jamcar23/openpilot/blob/src/common/op_params.py#L161) for the latest list of parameters.

**Warning: a `(live!)` param means that the changes will take affect ~2.5 seconds after making them without needing a reboot, it does *not* mean that you should change them while driving or that you should engage in other unsafe behavior.**

**Further more, in some cases, it's possible to enter the incorrect data into opParams which, at worst, can lead to a process crashing. You do *not* want this happening while driving.** I've done my best to make sure you can only enter safe data and to handle potential errors however, there's always edge cases that may be missed.

## Op Edit / Op Params
I have made a few changes to opEdit and opParams, huge shout-out to [Shane](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/opParams) for the original work he did.

- **Nested Parameters**: _Parameters can now be nested, or hidden, under other boolean parameters_
  - If the bool param has `enable` in it then it is usually used to toggle a feature (which includes its children) on or off (ex: `enable_lat_params`)
  - if the bool param has `show` in it then it usually only affects whether those params are shown in opEdit (ex: `show_indi_opts`)
- **Better list support**: _editing list in opEdit has been expanded with new features_
  - use `+value` to append a valid value to the end of a list
    - ex: if you have `[10, 20]` and you enter `+42` you'll get `[10, 20, 42]`
  - use `-index` to delete a valid index from the list
    - ex: if you have `[10, 20, 42]` and you enter `-1` you'll get `[10, 42]`
  - you can replace an entire list by typing out a valid python list
    - ex: if you have `[10, 42]` and you enter `[2, 5, 7]` you'll get `[2, 5, 7]`
- **Multidimensional List support**: _the new list features in opEdit apply to multidimensional lists of lists too_

## UI
I've made a few small changes to the UI as well.

- **Dev UI**: *Shows info on certain internal measurements, while on-road, which may be helpful when tuning*
  - Ex: `real_steer` vs `desired_steer`
  - Some numbers are color coated:
    - White: the value is in a normal range (or isn't color coated)
    - Green: the value is in an optimal range
    - Yellow: warning, the value is approaching a dangerous range or predefined safety limit
    - Red: danger, the value is in a dangerous range or is very close to a predefined safety limit
- **Brake Icon**: *Brake icon shows up when the car is applying the brakes*
- **Colored Path**: *The color of the path changes to reflect torque and engagement*
  - When engaged, it interpolates between green and red depending on the amount of torque being used. Greener values mean less torque.
  - Blue path means a steering correction / override is being applied.
  - Gray path means OP isn't engaged.

## Multidimensional Breakpoints
Multidimensional breakpoints (MDBPs) are a new, highly experimental feature which allows for more complex breakpoints that take into account multiple factors. In other words, you can have multiple sets of traditional breakpoints that are selected by evaluating another set of values. These can be further extended by defining different sources for each dimension allowing you to build highly customizable tunes which weren't previously possible. As an example: in lat tuning, you can now build a tune that not only takes into account the speed of the car (like we were previously) but also the desired steering angle of the path planner.

**Warning: please read and re-read the warnings in [Live Tuning](#live-tuning). Due to their complexity and flexibility, multidimensional breakpoints are harder to validate that correct data has been enter to `op_edit`. Additionally, because they're so new there might be a higher-than-usual amount of edge cases.**

*Note: at the moment these are only available for indi and steer actuator delay breakpoints. I'm working on adding this functionality to other breakpoints as it makes sense.*

*Note: In the future, I'd like to add an option to configure the operating mode. This would allow for other ways to evaluate MDBPs such as interpolating the value lists before interpolating the output.*

### How they work
Much like traditional breakpoints already in FP / OP multidimensional breakpoints also have `bp` and a `v` list, only this time they're a list of lists. Each list inside the `bp` list is a set of breakpoint points and can represent different factors. What these factors are is defined in another param called the `breakpoint source` (more below). Each list inside the `v` list is a set of output values.

Lets take a look at an example tuning the indi inner gain breakpoints:

**Example**

In this example I'll walk you through how multidimensional breakpoints work.

**Recap**

Before we take a look at multidimensional breakpoints lets first look at how normal breakpoints works. Consider the following:

```
indi_inner_gain_bp: [20, 24, 30]
indi_inner_gain_v: [7.25, 7.5, 9]
```

Here `bp` contains a set of `v_ego` points while `v` is a set of values for the indi controller. From there the controller would read the car's `v_ego` and performs a one-dimensional piecewise linear interpolation, that is: it finds the two closest points in `bp` to `v_ego` and then interpolates between the values (in `v`) at the same indexes as the ones found.

Examples:
  - `v_ego` = 10, output is `7.25`
    - since `v_ego` is less than the first point (in `bp`), the first value (in `v`) is returned.
  - `v_ego` = 35, output is `9`
    - because `v_ego` is larger than the last point, the last value is returned.
  - `v_ego` = 22, output is `7.375`
    - since 22 is 50% between the first and second points, the output is 50% between the first and second values. (Note: this is generalized to all %s i.e. 10% between points is 10% between values, etc.)

**Moving on**

Now back to multidimensional breakpoints. As mentioned, multidimensional breakpoints still have points (`bp`) and values (`v`) lists. Lets now define what valid multidimensional breakpoints would look like:

```
indi_inner_gain_bp_multi: [[0, 6], [20, 24, 30]]
indi_inner_gain_v_multi: [[5.25, 5.5, 6], [6, 6.75, 7]]
```

I mentioned earlier that each list inside of `bp` was a set of points for some source data but what are they in this case? Well, we need to define another parameter:

```
indi_multi_breakpoint_source: ['desired_steer', 'v_ego']
```

Here are our sources for our points (`bp`): `desired_steer` and `v_ego`. More specifically, the first list in `bp` (`[0, 6]`) are breakpoints for the `desired_steer` while the second list are the points for `v_ego`.

During evaluation, the controller compares the first source (`desired_steer`) to the closest index in the first list in `bp`(`[0, 6]`). Once it finds that index it selects the list at the same index from `v` and interpolates the second source (`v_ego`) points with the selected values as if it was a single dimensional array. In other words, you can have multiple sets of `v_ego` breakpoints that are selected based on the `desired_steer` of the path planner.

In the following lets look at some example evaluations. Here we'll be evaluating the `bp` and `v` arrays above by `x`. `x` is the input, it is a list with the same size as the `breakpoint source`. Each index in `x` is the value of the `breakpoint source` at that index. (Example: `x: [2, 24]` here the `desired_steer` is `2` while `v_ego` is `24`.)

**Examples:**
  - `x: [2, 24]`, output is `5.5`
    - 1st, compares `x[0]`(`2`) to `bp[0]`(`[0, 6]`)
    - 2nd, since `2` is closer to `0` select `v[0]`(`[5.25, 5.5, 6]`)
    - 3rd, `interp` `x[1]`(`24`) with `bp[1]`(`[20, 24, 30]`) and `v` from step 2
      - since `24` is at index `1` of `bp[1]`, index `1` of `v[0]` is returned
  - `x: [5, 35]`, output is `7`
    - 1st, compares `x[0]`(`5`) to `bp[0]`(`[0, 6]`)
    - 2nd, since `5` is closer to `6` select `v[1]`(`[6, 6.75, 7]`)
    - 3rd, `interp` `x[1]`(`35`) with `bp[1]`(`[20, 24, 30]`) and `v` from step 2
      - since `35` is larger than the last point in `bp[1]`, the last value in `v[1]` is returned
  - `x: [10, 5]`, output is `6`
    - 1st, compares `x[0]`(`10`) to `bp[0]`(`[0, 6]`)
    - 2nd, since `10` is closer to `6` select `v[1]`(`[6, 6.75, 7]`)
    - 3rd, `interp` `x[1]`(`5`) with `bp[1]`(`[20, 24, 30]`) and `v` from step 2
      - since `5` is smaller than the first point in `bp[1]`, the first value in `v[1]` is returned

*Note: this is a simplified and partially wrong / misleading example. For the correction see [Param Modifiers](#param-modifiers) (below).*

*Note: if it's not clear, step 3 is basically just a 1 dimensional interpolation, like the one shown in the recap, between the second set of points (`bp[1]`) and the selected set of values (`v`) from step 2.*

*Note: once again, I'm planning on expanding this by optionally interpolating both value arrays (i.e. a multidimensional interpolation) in the future.*


### Breakpoint Sources
Breakpoint sources are another set of parameters in OpParams however these are more of a "meta-param". In other words, they're a parameter that describes info about another parameter. More specifically they're used to know where to look when evaluating the multidimensional breakpoint.

In the examples above, how would `x` be created? There is a function which takes in the source list and other cereal messages (e.g. `CarState`, `PathPlan`, etc.), evaluates each items in the source list, and then selects the source's value from the correct message (it is during this step that [Param Modifiers](#param-modifiers) are applied to the source's value).

The following should be kept in mind for breakpoint sources:

1. Sources are predefined and you should only enter existing, valid sources (See [BreakPointSourceKeys](https://github.com/jamcar23/openpilot/blob/src/common/op_params.py#L93) for an up to date list). **At the moment, `op_edit` does *not* validate that the sources are correct, you *must* do this on your own.**
2. The order of sources matters and has a direct affect on how the breakpoints get evaluated. (*Exercise for the reader: how do the above examples change if the sources were switched (i.e. `['vego', 'desired_steer']`)?*)
3. Currently, this has only been tested using 2 sources. I'm currently evaluating how this feature might work if there were more.

*Note: at the moment, these are only being used for multidimensional breakpoints but I'm evaluating if these should be used in other places and or in other ways.*

### Param Modifiers
Param modifiers are special "keywords" that can be attached to the end of a string param in order to modify its value. See [ParamModifierKeys](https://github.com/jamcar23/openpilot/blob/src/common/op_params.py#L98) for an up to date list of available modifiers.

*Note: at the moment, these are only being used for breakpoint sources but I'm evaluating if these should be used in other places and or in other ways.*

**Example:**

Let's walk through another multidimensional breakpoint example with param modifiers or rather, let's rewalk through, and correct, the old one.

Let's start by defining our initial values again:

```
indi_inner_gain_bp_multi: [[0, 6], [20, 24, 30]]
indi_inner_gain_v_multi: [[5.25, 5.5, 6], [6, 6.75, 7]]
indi_multi_breakpoint_source: ['desired_steer', 'v_ego']
```

So far so good, right? Not quite. See, `desired_steer` is positive when the steering wheel turns counter-clockwise and negative when turning clockwise (in my Toyota Corolla, other cars may be different). Spot the error? All clockwise turns will use the smaller `v` values even during sharper turns (because negative numbers are closer to `0` than they are to `6`).

So how can we fix this? Two ways...

1. we can update our points (`bp`) and values (`v`) to reflect positive and negative angles. This works but it's kind of a pain to do everywhere and it makes dealing with the param in `op_edit` harder.

```
indi_inner_gain_bp_multi: [[-6, 0, 6], [20, 24, 30]]
indi_inner_gain_v_multi: [[6, 6.75, 7], [5.25, 5.5, 6], [6, 6.75, 7]]
```

2. we can use the `ABS` modifier to modify the value of the breakpoint source. In other words, we can take the absolute value of the desired steer from the path planner so that the value is always positive. To do this we append `_abs` to end of the source like so:

```
indi_multi_breakpoint_source: ['desired_steer_abs', 'v_ego']
```

Now that our `desired_steer` is always positive we can have our points (`bp`) and values (`v`) look like this again:

```
indi_inner_gain_bp_multi: [[0, 6], [20, 24, 30]]
indi_inner_gain_v_multi: [[5.25, 5.5, 6], [6, 6.75, 7]]
```

With our corrected points and values or corrected sources the breakpoint will evaluate as originally described in the above example.

### Final Thoughts
Here are my final thoughts on multidimensional breakpoints:

- This is still very experimental and mostly still a WIP.
- I'm very interested in the community's feedback on this. Not just what I have but also on future mechanics or other general ideas.
- I'm very interested in seeing what tunes the community can develop with this. The ones I've been experimenting with are already well beyond any other previous tunes.

Lastly, here is my current favorite multidimensional indi tune for the TSS2 Corolla:

```
indi_actuator_effectiveness_bp_multi: [[0, 5], [20, 24]]
indi_actuator_effectiveness_v_multi:[[1.5, 1.75], [2, 3]]
indi_inner_gain_bp_multi: [[0, 6, 15], [20, 24, 30]]
indi_inner_gain_v_multi: [[5.25, 5.5, 6.5], [6.25, 6.75, 8.5], [7.5, 8.5, 10]]
indi_outer_gain_bp_multi: [[0, 3, 7], [20, 24, 30]]
indi_outer_gain_v_multi: [[4, 4.5, 6], [4.5, 5.25, 6.25], [6, 6.5, 7.5]]
indi_time_constant_bp_multi: [[0, 5, 10], [20, 24, 30]]
indi_time_constant_v_multi: [[0.3, 0.5, 1], [1.25, 1.5], [2.25]]
indi_multi_breakpoint_source: ['desired_steer_abs', 'vego']

steer_actuator_delay_bp_multi: [[0], [0, 4, 9, 17]]
steer_actuator_delay_v_multi: [[0.45, 0.4, 0.3, 0.16]]
steer_actuator_delay_multi_bp_source: ['vego', 'desired_steer_abs']

corolla_body_type: 'sedan' (wheelbase: 2.7)
corolla_use_indi: True (tire_stiffness_factor: 0.996)
safetyParam: 50
```
